This is an FFXIV marketboard craft/buy optimization tool I made using Universalis and Streamlit. 
The UI elements I want need a full framework for synced checkbox state and the entire repo is a hackathon grade catastrophe from trying to make it work with Streamlit components.
I'm working on a rewrite but it's still useful for me, might as well toss it out there so I can throw it on streamlit community cloud.

Known issues:
* nothing in the right column is implemented
* center column doesnt check for duplicate mats/listings involved at multiple steps- this is what requires the rewrite  
* exclude crystals not implemented
